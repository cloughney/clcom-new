	<p>
		I am a full-stack software developer based in Los Angeles, CA.
		I'm a motivated and passionate individual driven by my curiosity and perpetual desire to improve myself and the projects that I take on.
		I have been intrigued by the power of software since I started scripting at a young age and that still motivates me to this day. 
		I have experience working with emerging businesses in need of small landing pages; designing and constructing large, complex web applications for some of the biggest names across multiple industries; and everything in between.
